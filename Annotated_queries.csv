1,Solar energy,1,What is solar energy?,"Solar energy is radiant light and heat from the Sun that is harnessed using a range of technologies such as solar power to generate electricity, solar thermal energy (including solar water heating), and solar architecture.It is an essential source of renewable energy, and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar power. Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems, concentrated solar power, and solar water heating to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light-dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air."
1,Solar energy,2,According to international energy ageny what are the long-term benefits of solar energy technologies?,"In 2011, the International Energy Agency said that ""the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries' energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible, and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating global warming .... these advantages are global""."
1,Solar energy,3,How do green plants use solar energy?,"Solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle. The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anticyclones.Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14 °C.By photosynthesis, green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived."
1,Solar energy,4,"What phenomenon is caused by absorption of solar radiation by the  Earth's surface, oceans, and atmosphere ?","Solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere.

1,Solar energy,5,What is difference between active solar techniques and passive solar techniques?,"Active solar techniques use photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, solar thermal collectors, pumps, and fans to convert sunlight into useful outputs. Passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties, designing spaces that naturally circulate air, and referencing the position of a building to the Sun. Active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered supply side technologies, while passive solar technologies reduce the need for alternate resources and are generally considered demand-side technologies."
1,Solar energy,6,What is pumped-storage hydroelectricity and how does it work,"Pumped-storage hydroelectricity stores energy in the form of water pumped when energy is available from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation one. The energy is recovered when demand is high by releasing the water, with the pump becoming a hydroelectric power generator."
1,Solar energy,7,What are some of the factors that limit the amount of solar energy that humans can acquire?,"The potential solar energy that could be used by humans differs from the amount of solar energy present near the surface of the planet because factors such as geography, time variation, cloud cover, and the land available to humans limit the amount of solar energy that we can acquire. In 2021, Carbon Tracker Initiative estimated the land area needed to generate all our energy from solar alone was 450,000 km2 — or about the same as the area of Sweden, or the area of Morocco, or the area of California (0.3% of the Earth's total land area)."
1,Solar energy,8,What is net metering and how does it work?,"Off-grid PV systems have traditionally used rechargeable batteries to store excess electricity. With grid-tied systems, excess electricity can be sent to the transmission grid, while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls. Net metering programs give household systems credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt-hour credit to the next month.Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions, making a second meter unnecessary."
1,Solar energy,9,What is solar aircraft?,"An electric aircraft is an aircraft that runs on electric motors rather than internal combustion engines, with electricity coming from fuel cells, solar cells, ultracapacitors, power beaming,or batteries."
1,Solar energy,10,How can Urban heat islands (UHI) effect be counteracted?,"Urban heat islands (UHI) are metropolitan areas with higher temperatures than that of the surrounding environment. The higher temperatures result from increased absorption of solar energy by urban materials such as asphalt and concrete, which have lower albedos and higher heat capacities than those in the natural environment. A straightforward method of counteracting the UHI effect is to paint buildings and roads white and to plant trees in the area. Using these methods, a hypothetical ""cool communities"" program in Los Angeles has projected that urban temperatures could be reduced by approximately 3 °C at an estimated cost of US$1  billion, giving estimated total annual benefits of US$530  million from reduced air-conditioning costs and healthcare savings."
2,Carbon footprint,11,What does carbon accounting measures?,"Carbon accounting (or greenhouse gas accounting) is a framework of methods to measure and track how much greenhouse gas (GHG) an organization emits.It can also be used to track projects or actions to reduce emissions in sectors such as forestry or renewable energy. Corporations, cities and other groups use these techniques to help limit climate change. Organizations will often set an emissions baseline, create targets for reducing emissions, and track progress towards them. The accounting methods enable them to do this in a more consistent and transparent manner."
2,Carbon footprint,12,What is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States according to the Environmental Protection Agency?,"Electricity generation and transport are major emitters; the largest single source, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, is transportation, accounting for 27% of all USA greenhouse gas emissions"
2,Carbon footprint,13,Whats if carbon offsetting?,"Reforestation, the restocking of existing forests or woodlands that have previously been depleted, is an example of Carbon Offsetting, the counteracting of carbon dioxide emissions with an equivalent reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.Carbon offsetting can reduce a companies overall carbon footprint by offering a carbon credit."
2,Carbon footprint,14,"What is the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, and what does it say about anthropogenic GHGs emissions?","The latest climate science is published in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report. The report presents key scientific findings linking the increase in anthropogenic GHGs emissions in current climate change. According to the report, it is only possible to avoid warming of 1.5 °C or 2 °C if massive and immediate cuts in greenhouse gas emissions are made. This is part of climate change mitigation measures."
2,Carbon footprint,15,What are different ways of measuring carbon footprint?,"An individual's, nation's, or organization's carbon footprint can be measured by undertaking a GHG emissions assessment, a life cycle assessment, or other calculative activities denoted as carbon accounting. Once the size of a carbon footprint is known, a strategy can be devised to reduce it, for example, by technological developments, energy efficiency improvements, better process and product management, changed Green Public or Private Procurement (GPP), carbon capture, consumption strategies, carbon offsetting and others."
2,Carbon footprint,16,What is the purpose of a life cycle or supply chain carbon footprint study?,"By calculating or predicting a process’ carbon footprint high emissions areas can be identified and steps can be taken to reduce in those areas. Collecting real data from suppliers emissions, setting a strategy focused on hot-spots and incentivizing suppliers are still barriers for companies. Nevertheless, solutions exist and the focus should be on improving year-on-year."
3,Energy crisis,17,What were the  different factors that led to energy crisis 2000?,"An energy crisis or energy shortage is any significant bottleneck in the supply of energy resources to an economy. In literature, it often refers to one of the energy sources used at a certain time and place, in particular, those that supply national electricity grids or those used as fuel in industrial development and population growth have led to a surge in the global demand for energy in recent years.In the 2000s, this new demand – together with Middle East tension, the falling value of the US dollar, dwindling oil reserves, concerns over peak oil, and oil price speculation – triggered the 2000s energy crisis, which saw the price of oil reach an all-time high of $147.30 per barrel ($926/m3) in 2008."
3,Energy crisis,18,Who developed oil depletion protocol?,"Andrew McKillop has been a proponent of a contract and converge model or capping scheme, to mitigate both emissions of greenhouse gases and a peak oil crisis. The imposition of a carbon tax would have mitigating effects on an oil crisis.The Oil Depletion Protocol has been developed by Richard Heinberg to implement a powerdown during a peak oil crisis. While many sustainable development and energy policy organisations have advocated reforms to energy development from the 1970s, some cater to a specific crisis in energy supply including Energy-Quest and the International Association for Energy Economics. The Oil Depletion Analysis Centre and the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas examine the timing and likely effects of peak oil."
4,Sustainable transport,19,What is sustainable transport and what components are evaluated for sustainability?,"Sustainable transport refers to ways of transportation that are sustainable in terms of their social and environmental impacts. Components for evaluating sustainability include the particular vehicles used for road, water or air transport; the source of energy; and the infrastructure used to accommodate the transport (roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals and terminals). Transport operations and logistics as well as transit-oriented development are also involved in evaluation.Transportation sustainability is largely being measured by transportation system effectiveness and efficiency as well as the environmental and climate impacts of the system.Transport systems have significant impacts on the environment, accounting for between 20% and 25% of world energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.The majority of the emissions, almost 97%, came from direct burning of fossil fuels.In 2019, about 95% of the fuel came from fossil sources. The main source of greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union is transportation. In 2019 it contributes to about 31% of global emissions and 24% of emissions in the EU. In addition, up to the COVID-19 pandemic, emissions have only increased in this one sector.Greenhouse gas emissions from transport are increasing at a faster rate than any other energy using sector.Road transport is also a major contributor to local air pollution and smog."
4,Sustainable transport,20,What is Greenxc and what is its mission?,"An organization called Greenxc started in 2011 created a national awareness campaign in the United States encouraging people to carpool by ride-sharing cross country stopping over at various destinations along the way and documenting their travel through video footage, posts and photography. Ride-sharing reduces individual's carbon footprint by allowing several people to use one car instead of everyone using individual cars."
4,Sustainable transport,21,What are some social equity and fairness issues that sustainable transport advocates are emphasizing?,"Whereas it started as a movement driven by environmental concerns, over these last years there has been increased emphasis on social equity and fairness issues, and in particular the need to ensure proper access and services for lower income groups and people with mobility limitations, including the fast-growing population of older citizens.Many of the people exposed to the most vehicle noise, pollution and safety risk have been those who do not own, or cannot drive cars, and those for whom the cost of car ownership causes a severe financial burden."
4,Sustainable transport,22,"What is the Samgöngugreiðslur scheme in Iceland, and what conditions must an employee meet to be eligible for it?","Several European countries are opening up financial incentives that support more sustainable modes of transport. The European Cyclists' Federation, which focuses on daily cycling for transport, has created a document containing a non-complete overview.In the UK, employers have for many years been providing employees with financial incentives. The employee leases or borrows a bike that the employer has purchased. You can also get other support. The scheme is beneficial for the employee who saves money and gets an incentive to get exercise integrated in the daily routine. The employer can expect a tax deduction, lower sick leave and less pressure on parking spaces for cars.Since 2010, there has been a scheme in Iceland (Samgöngugreiðslur) where those who do not drive a car to work, get paid a lump of money monthly. An employee must sign a statement not to use a car for work more often than one day a week, or 20% of the days for a period. Some employers pay fixed amounts based on trust. Other employers reimburse the expenses for repairs on bicycles, period-tickets for public transport and the like. Since 2013, amounts up to ISK 8000 per month have been tax-free. Most major workplaces offer this, and a significant proportion of employees use the scheme. Since 2019 half the amount is tax-free if the employee signs a contract not to use a car to work for more than 40% of the days of the contract period"
4,Sustainable transport,23,Who first attempted to evaluate the Life Cycle environmental impact of vehicles?,"The first historical attempts of evaluating the Life Cycle environmental impact of vehicle is due to Theodore Von Karman.After decades in which all the analysis has been focused on emending the Von Karman model, Dewulf and Van Langenhove have introduced a model based on the second law of thermodynamics and exergy analysis.Chester and Orwath,have developed a similar model based on the first law that accounts the necessary costs for the infrastructure."
4,Sustainable transport,24,What is the Online Electric Vehicle (OLEV) and how does it work?,"The Online Electric Vehicle (OLEV), developed by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), is an electric vehicle that can be charged while stationary or driving, thus removing the need to stop at a charging station. The City of Gumi in South Korea runs a 24 km roundtrip along which the bus will receive 100 kW (136 horsepower) electricity at an 85% maximum power transmission efficiency rate while maintaining a 17 cm air gap between the underbody of the vehicle and the road surface. At that power, only a few sections of the road need embedded cables.Hybrid vehicles, which use an internal combustion engine combined with an electric engine to achieve better fuel efficiency than a regular combustion engine, are already common."
4,Sustainable transport,25,"Why is investment in sustainable transport considered a ""win-win"" opportunity?","According to a series of serious reports by the Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP), sustainable transport can help create jobs,improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes, pedestrian pathways and non-pedestrian pathways,make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient. It also offers a practical opportunity to save people's time and household income as well as government budgets,making investment in sustainable transport a 'win-win' opportunity."
4,Sustainable transport,26,What is the motivation behind mobility transition?,"Mobility transition is a set of social, technological and political processes of converting traffic (including freight transport) and mobility to sustainable transport with renewable energy resources, and an integration of several different modes of private transport and local public transport. It also includes social change, a redistribution of public spaces,and different ways of financing and spending money in urban planning. The main motivation for mobility transition is the reduction of the harm and damage that traffic causes to people (mostly but not solely due to collisions) and the environment (which also often directly or indirectly affects people) in order to make (urban) society more livable, as well as solving various interconnected logistical, social, economic and energy issues and inefficiencies."
5,Biofuels,27,What is biofuel?,"Biofuel is a fuel that is produced over a short time span from biomass, rather than by the very slow natural processes involved in the formation of fossil fuels, such as oil. Biofuel can be produced from plants or from agricultural, domestic or industrial biowaste. The climate change mitigation potential of biofuel varies considerably, from emission levels comparable to fossil fuels in some scenarios to negative emissions in others. Biofuels are mostly used for transportation, but can also be used for heating and electricity. Biofuels (and bioenergy in general) are regarded as a renewable energy source."
5,Biofuels,28,What are the two most common types of biofuel?,"The two most common types of biofuel are bioethanol and biodiesel. The U.S. is the largest producer of bioethanol, while the EU is the largest producer of biodiesel. The energy content in the global production of bioethanol and biodiesel is 2.2 and 1.8 EJ per year, respectively.Demand for aviation biofuel is forecast to increase."
5,Biofuels,29,What are the advantages of using algae-based biofuels?,"Algal fuels have high yields,can be grown with minimal impact on fresh water resources,can be produced using saline water and wastewater, have a high ignition point,and are biodegradable and relatively harmless to the environment if spilled."
5,Biofuels,30,What are the disadvantages of using algae-based biofuels?,"Algae can be produced in ponds or tanks on land, and out at sea.Algal fuels have high yields,can be grown with minimal impact on fresh water resources,can be produced using saline water and wastewater, have a high ignition point,and are biodegradable and relatively harmless to the environment if spilled.Production requires large amounts of energy and fertilizer, the produced fuel degrades faster than other biofuels, and it does not flow well in cold temperatures."
5,Biofuels,31,What are the six ether additives used in transportation fuel?,"When it comes to transportation fuel there are six ether additives: dimethyl ether (DME), diethyl ether (DEE), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME), and tert-amyl ethyl ether (TAEE)."
5,Biofuels,32,How is hydrocracking used to produce green diesel?,"Green diesel is produced through hydrocracking biological oil feedstocks, such as vegetable oils and animal fats.Hydrocracking is a refinery method that uses elevated temperatures and pressure in the presence of a catalyst to break down larger molecules, such as those found in vegetable oils, into shorter hydrocarbon chains used in diesel engines.It may also be called renewable diesel, hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO fuel) or hydrogen-derived renewable diesel.Unlike biodiesel, green diesel has exactly the same chemical properties as petroleum-based diesel.It does not require new engines, pipelines or infrastructure to distribute and use, but has not been produced at a cost that is competitive with petroleum.Gasoline versions are also being developed.Green diesel is being developed in Louisiana and Singapore by ConocoPhillips, Neste Oil, Valero, Dynamic Fuels, and Honeywell UOP as well as Preem in Gothenburg, Sweden, creating what is known as Evolution Diesel."
5,Biofuels,33,Who are some companies developing green diesel and where are they located?,"Green diesel is produced through hydrocracking biological oil feedstocks, such as vegetable oils and animal fats.Hydrocracking is a refinery method that uses elevated temperatures and pressure in the presence of a catalyst to break down larger molecules, such as those found in vegetable oils, into shorter hydrocarbon chains used in diesel engines.It may also be called renewable diesel, hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO fuel) or hydrogen-derived renewable diesel.Unlike biodiesel, green diesel has exactly the same chemical properties as petroleum-based diesel.It does not require new engines, pipelines or infrastructure to distribute and use, but has not been produced at a cost that is competitive with petroleum.Gasoline versions are also being developed.Green diesel is being developed in Louisiana and Singapore by ConocoPhillips, Neste Oil, Valero, Dynamic Fuels, and Honeywell UOP as well as Preem in Gothenburg, Sweden, creating what is known as Evolution Diesel."
5,Biofuels,34,What are the sources that aviation biofuel can be produced from?,"Aviation biofuel can be produced from plant sources such as Jatropha, algae, tallows, waste oils, palm oil, Babassu, and Camelina (bio-SPK); from solid biomass using pyrolysis processed with a Fischer–Tropsch process (FT-SPK); with an alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) process from waste fermentation; or from synthetic biology through a solar reactor.Small piston engines can be modified to burn ethanol."
5,Biofuels,35,What products can be produced from syngas?,"Syngas can be used to produce methanol, dimethyl ether and hydrogen, or converted via the Fischer–Tropsch process to produce a diesel substitute, or a mixture of alcohols that can be blended into gasoline.Gasification normally relies on temperatures greater than 700 °C."
6,Sustainable energy,36,What are the negative impacts of burning fossil fuels and biomass?,"Fossil fuels provide 85% of the world's energy consumption, and the energy system is responsible for 76% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Around 790 million people in developing countries lack access to electricity, and 2.6 billion rely on polluting fuels such as wood or charcoal to cook. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to levels consistent with the 2015 Paris Agreement will require a system-wide transformation of the way energy is produced, distributed, stored, and consumed. The burning of fossil fuels and biomass is a major contributor to air pollution, which causes an estimated 7 million deaths each year. Therefore, the transition to a low-carbon energy system would have strong co-benefits for human health. Pathways exist to provide universal access to electricity and clean cooking in ways that are compatible with climate goals while bringing major health and economic benefits to developing countries."
6,Sustainable energy,37,What is the goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change?,"The current energy system contributes to many environmental problems, including climate change, air pollution, biodiversity loss, the release of toxins into the environment, and water scarcity. As of 2019, 85% of the world's energy needs are met by burning fossil fuels.Energy production and consumption are responsible for 76% of annual human-caused greenhouse gas emissions as of 2018.The 2015 international Paris Agreement on climate change aims to limit global warming to well below 2 °C (3.6 °F) and preferably to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F); achieving this goal will require that emissions be reduced as soon as possible and reach net-zero by mid-century."
6,Sustainable energy,38,What is the energy intensity of the global economy ?,"The energy intensity of the global economy (the amount of energy consumed per unit of gross domestic product (GDP)) is a rough indicator of the energy efficiency of economic production.In 2010, global energy intensity was 5.6 megajoules (1.6 kWh) per US dollar of GDP.United Nations goals call for energy intensity to decrease by 2.6% each year between 2010 and 2030.In recent years this target has not been met. For instance, between 2017 and 2018, energy intensity decreased by only 1.1%. Efficiency improvements often lead to a rebound effect in which consumers use the money they save to buy more energy-intensive goods and services.For example, recent technical efficiency improvements in transport and buildings have been largely offset by trends in consumer behaviour, such as selecting larger vehicles and homes."
6,Sustainable energy,39,What are some commonly used methods for energy storage?,"Energy storage helps overcome barriers to intermittent renewable energy and is an important aspect of a sustainable energy system.The most commonly used and available storage method is pumped-storage hydroelectricity, which requires locations with large differences in height and access to water.Batteries, especially lithium-ion batteries, are also deployed widely.Batteries typically store electricity for short periods; research is ongoing into technology with sufficient capacity to last through seasons.Costs of utility-scale batteries in the US have fallen by around 70% since 2015, however the cost and low energy density of batteries makes them impractical for the very large energy storage needed to balance inter-seasonal variations in energy production.Pumped hydro storage and power-to-gas (converting electricity to gas and back) with capacity for multi-month usage has been implemented in some locations."
6,Sustainable energy,40,What is the easiest and fastest way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the electricity sector?,"Compared to the rest of the energy system, emissions can be reduced much faster in the electricity sector.As of 2019, 37% of global electricity is produced from low-carbon sources (renewables and nuclear energy). Fossil fuels, primarily coal, produce the rest of the electricity supply.One of the easiest and fastest ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to phase out coal-fired power plants and increase renewable electricity generation."
6,Sustainable energy,41,What is district heating and how can it be made more efficient?,"A highly efficient way to heat buildings is through district heating, in which heat is generated in a centralised location and then distributed to multiple buildings through insulated pipes.Traditionally, most district heating systems have used fossil fuels, but modern and cold district heating systems are designed to use high shares of renewable energy."
7,Energy economics,42,What does energy economics mean?,"Energy economics is a broad scientific subject area which includes topics related to supply and use of energy in societies.Considering the cost of energy services and associated value gives economic meaning to the efficiency at which energy can be produced.Energy services can be defined as functions that generate and provide energy to the “desired end services or states”.The efficiency of energy services is dependent on the engineered technology used to produce and supply energy. The goal is to minimise energy input required (e.g. kWh, mJ, see Units of Energy) to produce the energy service, such as lighting (lumens), heating (temperature) and fuel (natural gas). The main sectors considered in energy economics are transportation and building, although it is relevant to a broad scale of human activities, including households and businesses at a microeconomic level and resource management and environmental impacts at a macroeconomic level."
7,Energy economics,43,What are the three main economic subjects that have contributed to the development of energy economics theory?,"Development of energy economics theory over the last two centuries can be attributed to three main economic subjects – the rebound effect, the energy efficiency gap and more recently, 'green nudges'."
7,Energy economics,44,What are the three sub-theories of the rebound effect?,"While energy efficiency is improved with new technology, expected energy savings are less-than proportional to the efficiency gains due to behavioural responses.There are three behavioural sub-theories to be considered: the direct rebound effect, which anticipates increased use of the energy service that was improved; the indirect rebound effect, which considers an increased income effect created by savings then allowing for increased energy consumption, and; the economy-wide effect, which results from an increase in energy prices due to the newly developed technology improvements."
8,Wind power,45,How can small onshore wind farms be utilized in the energy grid?,Small onshore wind farms can feed some energy into the grid or provide power to isolated off-grid locations.
8,Wind power,46,How does weather forecasting assist in wind power management?,"While the output from a single turbine can vary greatly and rapidly as local wind speeds vary, as more turbines are connected over larger and larger areas the average power output becomes less variable and more predictable.Weather forecasting permits the electric-power network to be readied for the predictable variations in production that occur."
8,Wind power,47,What is the recommended rate of expansion for wind power in order to meet the Paris Agreement goals?,"In 2021, wind supplied over 1800 TWh of electricity, which was over 6% of world electricity and about 2% of world energy.With about 100 GW added during 2021, mostly in China and the United States, global installed wind power capacity exceeded 800 GW.To help meet the Paris Agreement goals to limit climate change, analysts say it should expand much faster - by over 1% of electricity generation per year."
8,Wind power,48,How do tools like Renewables.ninja provide more detailed assessments of wind resource potential?,"Through wind resource assessment, it is possible to estimate wind power potential globally, by country or region, or for a specific site. The Global Wind Atlas provided by the Technical University of Denmark in partnership with the World Bank provides a global assessment of wind power potential.Unlike 'static' wind resource atlases which average estimates of wind speed and power density across multiple years, tools such as Renewables.ninja provide time-varying simulations of wind speed and power output from different wind turbine models at an hourly resolution.More detailed, site-specific assessments of wind resource potential can be obtained from specialist commercial providers, and many of the larger wind developers have in-house modeling capabilities."
8,Wind power,49,How do transmission losses affect power transmission for wind farms?,"Wind power resources are not always located near to high population density.As transmission lines become longer, the losses associated with power transmission increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased; making it harder to transport large loads over large distances."
8,Wind power,50,What happens when the transmission capacity doesn't meet the generation capacity of a wind farm?,"When the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running altogether, in a process known as curtailment. While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service."
8,Wind power,51,Why is developing new transmission lines a challenge for wind power grid integration in some countries?,"One of the biggest current challenges to wind power grid integration in some countries is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated areas due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher.Any existing transmission lines in remote locations may not have been designed for the transport of large amounts of energy.In particular geographic regions, peak wind speeds may not coincide with peak demand for electrical power, whether offshore or onshore. A possible future option may be to interconnect widely dispersed geographic areas with an HVDC super grid."
8,Wind power,52,What factors are taken into consideration when estimating the average cost per unit of electric power for wind turbines?,"Wind power is capital intensive but has no fuel costs.The price of wind power is therefore much more stable than the volatile prices of fossil fuel sources.However, the estimated average cost per unit of electric power must incorporate the cost of construction of the turbine and transmission facilities, borrowed funds, return to investors (including the cost of risk), estimated annual production, and other components, averaged over the projected useful life of the equipment, which may be more than 20 years. Energy cost estimates are highly dependent on these assumptions so published cost figures can differ substantially."
8,Wind power,53,What is small-scale wind power?,"Small-scale wind power is the name given to wind generation systems with the capacity to produce up to 50 kW of electrical power. Isolated communities, that may otherwise rely on diesel generators, may use wind turbines as an alternative. Individuals may purchase these systems to reduce or eliminate their dependence on grid electric power for economic reasons, or to reduce their carbon footprint. Wind turbines have been used for household electric power generation in conjunction with battery storage over many decades in remote areas."
8,Wind power,54,Where can airborne wind turbines be used and why?,"Airborne wind turbines, such as kites, can be used in places at risk of hurricanes, as they can be taken down in advance."
9,Green building,55,What is green building and what does it encompass?,"Green building (also known as green construction or sustainable building) refers to both a structure and the application of processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building's life-cycle: from planning to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition.This requires close cooperation of the contractor, the architects, the engineers, and the client at all project stages.The Green Building practice expands and complements the classical building design concerns of economy, utility, durability, and comfort.Green building also refers to saving resources to the maximum extent, including energy saving, land saving, water saving, material saving, etc., during the whole life cycle of the building, protecting the environment and reducing pollution, providing people with healthy, comfortable and efficient use of space, and being in harmony with nature Buildings that live in harmony. Green building technology focuses on low consumption, high efficiency, economy, environmental protection, integration and optimization."
9,Green building,56,What is Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)?,"Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a set of rating systems for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of green buildings which was developed by the U.S. Green Building Council.Other certificate systems that confirm the sustainability of buildings are the British BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) for buildings and large-scale developments or the DGNB System (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Nachhaltiges Bauen e.V.) which benchmarks the sustainability performance of buildings, indoor environments and districts. Currently, the World Green Building Council is conducting research on the effects of green buildings on the health and productivity of their users and is working with the World Bank to promote Green Buildings in Emerging Markets through EDGE (Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies) Market Transformation Program and certification.There are also other tools such as Green Star in Australia, Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) used in the Middle East and the Green Building Index (GBI) predominantly used in Malaysia."
9,Green building,57,What is the origin of sustainable development ?,"The concept of sustainable development can be traced to the energy (especially fossil oil) crisis and environmental pollution concerns of the 1960s and 1970s.The Rachel Carson book, ""Silent Spring"",published in 1962, is considered to be one of the first initial efforts to describe sustainable development as related to green building.The green building movement in the U.S. originated from the need and desire for more energy efficient and environmentally friendly construction practices. There are a number of motives for building green, including environmental, economic, and social benefits.However, modern sustainability initiatives call for an integrated and synergistic design to both new construction and in the retrofitting of existing structures. Also known as sustainable design, this approach integrates the building life-cycle with each green practice employed with a design-purpose to create a synergy among the practices used."
9,Green building,58,How does green building take advantage of renewable resources?,"Green building brings together a vast array of practices, techniques, and skills to reduce and ultimately eliminate the impacts of buildings on the environment and human health. It often emphasizes taking advantage of renewable resources, e.g., using sunlight through passive solar, active solar, and photovoltaic equipment, and using plants and trees through green roofs, rain gardens, and reduction of rainwater run-off. Many other techniques are used, such as using low-impact building materials or using packed gravel or permeable concrete instead of conventional concrete or asphalt to enhance replenishment of groundwater."

Many other techniques are used, such as using low-impact building materials or using packed gravel or permeable concrete instead of conventional concrete or asphalt to enhance replenishment of groundwater."
9,Green building,60,What is deconstruction and how can it be used to reduce waste in building materials?," Deconstruction is a method of harvesting what is commonly considered ""waste"" and reclaiming it into useful building material. Extending the useful life of a structure also reduces waste – building materials such as wood that are light and easy to work with make renovations easier."
9,Green building,61,What are some options for reducing the impact on wells or water treatment plants in terms of wastewater?,"To reduce the impact on wells or water treatment plants, several options exist. ""Greywater"", wastewater from sources such as dishwashing or washing machines, can be used for subsurface irrigation, or if treated, for non-potable purposes, e.g., to flush toilets and wash cars. Rainwater collectors are used for similar purposes."
9,Green building,62,"What are some examples of building materials considered ""green""?","Building materials typically considered 'green' include lumber( that has been certified to a third-party standard), rapidly renewable plant materials (like bamboo and straw), dimension stone, recycled stone, hempcrete, recycled metal (see: copper sustainability and recyclability), and other non-toxic, reusable, renewable, and/or recyclable products. Materials with lower embodied energy can be used in substitution to common building materials with high degrees of energy consumption and carbon/harmful emissions. For concrete a high performance self-healing version is available,however options with lower yields of pollutive waste entertain ideas of upcycling and congregate supplementing; replacing traditional concrete mixes with slag, production waste, and aggregates.Insulation also sees multiple angles for substitution. Commonly used fiberglass has competition from other eco-friendly, low energy embodying insulators with similar or higher R-values (per inch of thickness) at a competitive price. Sheep wool, cellulose, and ThermaCork perform more efficiently, however, use may be limited by transportation or installation costs."
9,Green building,63,"Who established the IPCC, and what does it aim to do?","Climate Change 2007, the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), is the fourth in a series of such reports.The IPCC was established by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to assess scientific, technical and socio-economic information concerning climate change, its potential effects and options for adaptation and mitigation."
10,Energy storage,64,Can you provide some common examples of energy storage?,"Common examples of energy storage are the rechargeable battery, which stores chemical energy readily convertible to electricity to operate a mobile phone; the hydroelectric dam, which stores energy in a reservoir as gravitational potential energy; and ice storage tanks, which store ice frozen by cheaper energy at night to meet peak daytime demand for cooling. Green hydrogen, from electrolysis of water, is a more economical means of long-term renewable energy storage in terms of capital expenditures than pumped-storage hydroelectricity or batteries.Fossil fuels such as coal and gasoline store ancient energy derived from sunlight by organisms that later died, became buried and over time were then converted into these fuels. Food (which is made by the same process as fossil fuels) is a form of energy stored in chemical form."

Food (which is made by the same process as fossil fuels) is a form of energy stored in chemical form."
10,Energy storage,66,"What is the difference between pure pumped-storage plants and the ""pump-back"" approach?","At times of low electrical demand, excess generation capacity is used to pump water from a lower source into a higher reservoir. When demand grows, water is released back into a lower reservoir (or waterway or body of water) through a turbine, generating electricity. Reversible turbine-generator assemblies act as both a pump and turbine (usually a Francis turbine design). Nearly all facilities use the height difference between two water bodies.Pure pumped-storage plants shift the water between reservoirs, while the ""pump-back"" approach is a combination of pumped storage and conventional hydroelectric plants that use natural stream-flow."
10,Energy storage,67,What are the three ways in which a CAES system can deal with the heat generated during compression?,"Compression of air creates heat; the air is warmer after compression. Expansion requires heat. If no extra heat is added, the air will be much colder after expansion. If the heat generated during compression can be stored and used during expansion, efficiency improves considerably.A CAES system can deal with the heat in three ways. Air storage can be adiabatic, diabatic, or isothermal. Another approach uses compressed air to power vehicles."
10,Energy storage,68,How does flywheel energy storage work?,"Flywheel energy storage (FES) works by accelerating a rotor (a flywheel) to a very high speed, holding energy as rotational energy. When energy is added the rotational speed of the flywheel increases, and when energy is extracted, the speed declines, due to conservation of energy."
10,Energy storage,69,"What is a steam accumulator, and how does it relate to LHTES?",A steam accumulator is a type of LHTES where the phase change is between liquid and gas and uses the latent heat of vaporization of water. Ice storage air conditioning systems use off-peak electricity to store cold by freezing water into ice.  The stored cold in ice releases during melting process and can be used for cooling at peak hours.
10,Energy storage,70,"What is Energy Storage on Energy Invested (ESOI), and how is it used to measure the energy efficiency of storage technologies like lithium-ion batteries and pumped hydroelectric storage?","A metric of energy efficiency of storage is energy storage on energy invested (ESOI), which is the amount of energy that can be stored by a technology, divided by the amount of energy required to build that technology. The higher the ESOI, the better the storage technology is energetically. For lithium-ion batteries this is around 10, and for lead acid batteries it is about 2. Other forms of storage such as pumped hydroelectric storage generally have higher ESOI, such as 210."
11,Artificial intelligence,71,What is artificial intelligence?,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence of humans and other animals. Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs."
11,Artificial intelligence,72,What are some examples of AI applications?,"AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).[1]"
11,Artificial intelligence,73,What are the traditional goals of AI research?,"The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects."
11,Artificial intelligence,74,What is the field of AI founded on?,"The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence ""can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it"".[b] This raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction, and philosophy since antiquity.[13] Computer scientists and philosophers have since suggested that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards beneficial goals.[c] The term artificial intelligence has also been criticized for overhyping AI's true technological capabilities.[14][15][16]"
11,Artificial intelligence,75,What is superintelligence?,"Superintelligence refers to the hypothetical agent or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent that would surpass that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. It is possible that if research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself, leading to recursive self-improvement. Its intelligence would increase exponentially in an intelligence explosion and could dramatically surpass humans."
11,Artificial intelligence,76,What is transhumanism?,Transhumanism is the idea that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea has roots in Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger.
11,Artificial intelligence,77,What is the risk associated with machine-learning AI?,"AI programs can become biased after learning from real-world data. It is not typically introduced by the system designers but is learned by the program, and thus the programmers are often unaware that the bias exists. AI is used to classify individuals into groups and then make predictions assuming that the individual will resemble other members of the group. In some cases, this assumption may be unfair. Health equity issues may also be exacerbated when many-to-many mapping is done without taking steps to ensure equity for populations at risk for bias. Other risks include technological unemployment, bad actors and weaponized AI, and existential risk."
11,Artificial intelligence,78,What were the two visions for achieving machine intelligence that emerged in the 1950s?,"The two visions were Symbolic AI (GOFAI), which aimed to create a symbolic representation of the world and systems that could reason about the world, and the connectionist approach, which aimed to achieve intelligence through learning."
11,Artificial intelligence,79,How does bias gets added into an AI programm?,"AI programs can become biased after learning from real-world data. It is not typically introduced by the system designers but is learned by the program, and thus the programmers are often unaware that the bias exists.Bias can be inadvertently introduced by the way training data is selected.It can also emerge from correlations: AI is used to classify individuals into groups and then make predictions assuming that the individual will resemble other members of the group"
12,Reinforcement learning,80,How is reinforcement learning different from supervised learning?,"Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input/output pairs to be presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected. Instead the focus is on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge)."
12,Reinforcement learning,81,What is the difference between full observability and partial observability in reinforcement learning?,"Formulating the problem as an MDP assumes the agent directly observes the current environmental state; in this case the problem is said to have full observability. If the agent only has access to a subset of states, or if the observed states are corrupted by noise, the agent is said to have partial observability, and formally the problem must be formulated as a Partially observable Markov decision process."
12,Reinforcement learning,82,What is the goal of the policy evaluation step in Monte Carlo?,"Monte Carlo is used in the policy evaluation step. In this step, given a stationary, deterministic policy 
�\pi , the goal is to compute the function values 
�
�
(
�
,
�
)
Q^{\pi }(s,a) (or a good approximation to them) for all state-action pairs 
(
�
,
�
)
(s,a). Assume (for simplicity) that the MDP is finite, that sufficient memory is available to accommodate the action-values and that the problem is episodic and after each episode a new one starts from some random initial state. Then, the estimate of the value of a given state-action pair 
(
�
,
�
)
(s,a) can be computed by averaging the sampled returns that originated from 
(

,
�
)
(s,a) over time. Given sufficient time, this procedure can thus construct a precise estimate 
�
Q of the action-value function 
�
�Q^{\pi }. This finishes the description of the policy evaluation step."
12,Reinforcement learning,83,How is reward function inferred in inverse reinforcement learning?,"In inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), no reward function is given. Instead, the reward function is inferred given an observed behavior from an expert. The idea is to mimic observed behavior, which is often optimal or close to optimal."
12,Reinforcement learning,84,What is safe reinforcement learning?,Safe reinforcement learning (SRL) can be defined as the process of learning policies that maximize the expectation of the return in problems in which it is important to ensure reasonable system performance and/or respect safety constraints during the learning and/or deployment processes.
12,Reinforcement learning,85,What is the purpose of reinforcement learning?,"The purpose of reinforcement learning is for the agent to learn an optimal, or nearly-optimal, policy that maximizes the ""reward function"" or other user-provided reinforcement signal that accumulates from the immediate rewards. This is similar to processes that appear to occur in animal psychology. For example, biological brains are hardwired to interpret signals such as pain and hunger as negative reinforcements, and interpret pleasure and food intake as positive reinforcements. In some circumstances, animals can learn to engage in behaviors that optimize these rewards. This suggests that animals are capable of reinforcement learning."
12,Reinforcement learning,86,What is a stationary policy?,A policy is stationary if the action-distribution returned by it depends only on the last state visited (from the observation agent's history).
12,Reinforcement learning,87,What is the purpose of  extending FRL with fuzzy rule interpolation?,Extending FRL with Fuzzy Rule Interpolation [44] allows the use of reduced size sparse fuzzy rule-bases to emphasize cardinal rules (most important state-action values).
13,Swarm intelligence,88,Give some examples of swarm intelligence.,"Examples of swarm intelligence in natural systems include ant colonies, bee colonies, bird flocking, hawks hunting, animal herding, bacterial growth, fish schooling and microbial intelligence."
13,Swarm intelligence,89,Which algorithms were used by in  al-Rifaie and team in their research works?,"In a series of works, al-Rifaie et al.[58] have successfully used two swarm intelligence algorithms—one mimicking the behaviour of one species of ants (Leptothorax acervorum) foraging (stochastic diffusion search, SDS) and the other algorithm mimicking the behaviour of birds flocking (particle swarm optimization, PSO)—to describe a novel integration strategy exploiting the local search properties of the PSO with global SDS behaviour. "
13,Swarm intelligence,90,Explain Swarm grammars in brief.,Swarm grammars are swarms of stochastic grammars that can be evolved to describe complex properties such as found in art and architecture.These grammars interact as agents behaving according to rules of swarm intelligence.
13,Swarm intelligence,91,How does human swarming harness collective intelligence?,"Networks of distributed users can be organized into ""human swarms"" through the implementation of real-time closed-loop control systems.Human swarming allows the collective intelligence of interconnected groups of people online to be harnessed. "
13,Swarm intelligence,92,What is the optimization algorithm introduced by Dorigo?,"Ant colony optimization (ACO), introduced by Dorigo in his doctoral dissertation, is a class of optimization algorithms modeled on the actions of an ant colony."
13,Swarm intelligence,93,What kind of problems are best suited for particle swarm optimization algorithm?,Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a global optimization algorithm for dealing with problems in which a best solution can be represented as a point or surface in an n-dimensional space. 
13,Swarm intelligence,94,Give some applications of swarm intelligence based technique.,Swarm Intelligence-based techniques can be used in a number of applications. The U.S. military is investigating swarm techniques for controlling unmanned vehicles. The European Space Agency is thinking about an orbital swarm for self-assembly and interferometry. NASA is investigating the use of swarm technology for planetary mapping. A 1992 paper by M. Anthony Lewis and George A. Bekey discusses the possibility of using swarm intelligence to control nanobots within the body for the purpose of killing cancer tumors.Conversely al-Rifaie and Aber have used stochastic diffusion search to help locate tumours.Swarm intelligence has also been applied for data mining and cluster analysis.
14,Augmented reality,95,What are the three features of an AR system?,"AR can be defined as a system that incorporates three basic features: a combination of real and virtual worlds, real-time interaction, and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects."
14,Augmented reality,96,Explain the design features of AR contact lens patented by Samsung.,"A patent filed by Samsung describes an AR contact lens, that, when finished, will include a built-in camera on the lens itself.The design is intended to control its interface by blinking an eye. It is also intended to be linked with the user's smartphone to review footage, and control it separately. When successful, the lens would feature a camera, or sensor inside of it. It is said that it could be anything from a light sensor, to a temperature sensor."
14,Augmented reality,97,Can you provide an example of how VR can be used in architecture?,"For example, in architecture, VR can be used to create a walk-through simulation of the inside of a new building; and AR can be used to show a building's structures and systems super-imposed on a real-life view."
14,Augmented reality,98,Why are mobile augmented reality applications gaining popularity?,Mobile augmented reality applications are gaining popularity because of the wide adoption of mobile and especially wearable devices.
14,Augmented reality,99,How can visual design assist users in navigating an AR application?,"To improve the graphic interface elements and user interaction, developers may use visual cues to inform the user what elements of UI are designed to interact with and how to interact with them. Since navigating in an AR application may appear difficult and seem frustrating, visual cue design can make interactions seem more natural."
14,Augmented reality,100,How can designers ensure seamless integration of augmeneted reality relative to the real-world environment?,"When virtual objects are projected onto a real environment, it is challenging for augmented reality application designers to ensure a perfectly seamless integration relative to the real-world environment, especially with 2D objects. As such, designers can add weight to objects, use depths maps, and choose different material properties that highlight the object's presence in the real world. Another visual design that can be applied is using different lighting techniques or casting shadows to improve overall depth judgment."
14,Augmented reality,101,How is VRD technology being considered for use in surgical displays and for patients with low vision?,The VRD is considered a preferred candidate to use in a surgical display due to its combination of high resolution and high contrast and brightness. Additional tests show high potential for VRD to be used as a display technology for patients that have low vision.
14,Augmented reality,102,What are the advantages and disadvantages of handheld AR?,"The two main advantages of handheld AR are the portable nature of handheld devices and the ubiquitous nature of camera phones. The disadvantages are the physical constraints of the user having to hold the handheld device out in front of them at all times, as well as the distorting effect of classically wide-angled mobile phone cameras when compared to the real world as viewed through the eye."
14,Augmented reality,103,How do games like Pokémon Go and Ingress use AR technology?,"Games such as Pokémon Go and Ingress utilize an Image Linked Map (ILM) interface, where approved geotagged locations appear on a stylized map for the user to interact with."
15,Generative adversarial network,104,How does the basic idea of GANs work?,"The core idea of a GAN is based on the ""indirect"" training through the discriminator, another neural network that can tell how ""realistic"" the input seems, which itself is also being updated dynamically. This means that the generator is not trained to minimize the distance to a specific image, but rather to fool the discriminator. This enables the model to learn in an unsupervised manner."
15,Generative adversarial network,105,Explain how GANs are implicit.,"GANs are implicit generative models, which means that they do not explicitly model the likelihood function nor provide a means for finding the latent variable corresponding to a given sample, unlike alternatives such as flow-based generative model."
15,Generative adversarial network,106,What is the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in state-of-the-art transfer learning research?,"State-of-art transfer learning research use GANs to enforce the alignment of the latent feature space, such as in deep reinforcement learning. This works by feeding the embeddings of the source and target task to the discriminator which tries to guess the context. The resulting loss is then (inversely) backpropagated through the encoder."
15,Generative adversarial network,107,What is mode collapse in GANs?,"GANs often suffer from mode collapse where they fail to generalize properly, missing entire modes from the input data. "
15,Generative adversarial network,108,Describe the role of generative and discriminative network in GANs.,"The generative network generates candidates while the discriminative network evaluates them. The contest operates in terms of data distributions. Typically, the generative network learns to map from a latent space to a data distribution of interest, while the discriminative network distinguishes candidates produced by the generator from the true data distribution. The generative network's training objective is to increase the error rate of the discriminative network (i.e., ""fool"" the discriminator network by producing novel candidates that the discriminator thinks are not synthesized (are part of the true data distribution))."
16,Robotics,109,Give some use cases of robots.,"Robotics develops machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. Robots can be used in many situations for many purposes, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including inspection of radioactive materials, bomb detection and deactivation), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive (e.g., in space, underwater, in high heat, and clean up and containment of hazardous materials and radiation)."
16,Robotics,110,What factors should be considered while creating battery powered robot?,"Designing a battery-powered robot needs to take into account factors such as safety, cycle lifetime, and weight. Generators, often some type of internal combustion engine, can also be used."
16,Robotics,111,How does series elastic actuation ensures safety from robots?,"Series elastic actuation (SEA) relies on the idea of introducing intentional elasticity between the motor actuator and the load for robust force control. Due to the resultant lower reflected inertia, series elastic actuation improves safety when a robot interacts with the environment (e.g., humans or workpieces) or during collisions."
16,Robotics,112,Describe different operations method of piezo motors.,There are different mechanisms of operation; one type uses the vibration of the piezo elements to step the motor in a circle or a straight line. Another type uses the piezo elements to cause a nut to vibrate or to drive a screw.
16,Robotics,113,How is the electrical aspect of robots used?,"The electrical aspect of robots is used for movement (through motors), sensing (where electrical signals are used to measure things like heat, sound, position, and energy status), and operation (robots need some level of electrical energy supplied to their motors and sensors in order to activate and perform basic operations)"
16,Robotics,114,What are mechanical grippers?,"One of the most common types of end-effectors are ""grippers"". In its simplest manifestation, it consists of just two fingers that can open and close to pick up and let go of a range of small objects."
17,Pattern recognition,115,What is pattern recognition and what are some of its applications?,"Pattern recognition is the automated recognition of patterns and regularities in data. It has applications in statistical data analysis, signal processing, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, computer graphics and machine learning."
17,Pattern recognition,116,Give some basic examples of pattern recognition techniques.,"Other typical applications of pattern recognition techniques are automatic speech recognition, speaker identification, classification of text into several categories (e.g., spam or non-spam email messages), the automatic recognition of handwriting on postal envelopes, automatic recognition of images of human faces, or handwriting image extraction from medical forms."
17,Pattern recognition,117,Describe feature selection.,"Feature selection algorithms attempt to directly prune out redundant or irrelevant features. A general introduction to feature selection which summarizes approaches and challenges, has been given.[6] The complexity of feature-selection is, because of its non-monotonous character, an optimization problem where given a total of 
?
n features the powerset consisting of all 
2
?
?
1
2^{n}-1 subsets of features need to be explored."
17,Pattern recognition,118,How do probabilistic algorithms differ from other algorithms in terms of output?,"Unlike other algorithms, which simply output a ""best"" label, often probabilistic algorithms also output a probability of the instance being described by the given label."
17,Pattern recognition,119,What is the advantage of probabilistic algorithms over non-probabilistic algorithms?," Probabilistic algorithms have many advantages over non-probabilistic algorithms:

They output a confidence value associated with their choice. (Note that some other algorithms may also output confidence values, but in general, only for probabilistic algorithms is this value mathematically grounded in probability theory. Non-probabilistic confidence values can in general not be given any specific meaning, and only used to compare against other confidence values output by the same algorithm.)
Correspondingly, they can abstain when the confidence of choosing any particular output is too low.
Because of the probabilities output, probabilistic pattern-recognition algorithms can be more effectively incorporated into larger machine-learning tasks, in a way that partially or completely avoids the problem of error propagation."
18,Chatbot,120,What is a chatbot or chatterbot?,"A chatbot or chatterbot is a software application used to conduct an online chat conversation via text or text-to-speech, in lieu of providing direct contact with a live human agent.[1][2] Chatbots are computer programs that are capable of maintaining a conversation with a user in natural language, understanding their intent, and replying based on preset rules and data."
18,Chatbot,121,"Who coined the term ""ChatterBot"" and when?","The term ""ChatterBot"" was originally coined by Michael Mauldin (creator of the first Verbot) in 1994 to describe these conversational programs."
18,Chatbot,122,What are the methods used by chatbots to generate responses?," While some chatbot applications use extensive word-classification processes, natural-language processors, and sophisticated AI, others simply scan for general keywords and generate responses using common phrases obtained from an associated library or database."
18,Chatbot,123,Tell me about ELIZA's operation method in brief.,"ELIZA's key method of operation (copied by chatbot designers ever since) involves the recognition of clue words or phrases in the input, and the output of the corresponding pre-prepared or pre-programmed responses that can move the conversation forward in an apparently meaningful way (e.g. by responding to any input that contains the word 'MOTHER' with 'TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY'). Thus an illusion of understanding is generated, even though the processing involved has been merely superficial."
18,Chatbot,124,What are drawbacks of chatbots?,"The most common limitations are listed below:

As the input/output database is fixed and limited, chatbots can fail while dealing with an unsaved query.
A chatbot's efficiency highly depends on language processing and is limited because of irregularities, such as accents and mistakes.
Chatbots are unable to deal with multiple questions at the same time and so conversation opportunities are limited.
Chatbots require a large amount of conversational data to train. Generative models, which are based on deep learning algorithms to generate new responses word by word based on user input, are usually trained on a large dataset of natural-language phrases.
Chatbots have difficulty managing non-linear conversations that must go back and forth on a topic with a user.
As it happens usually with technology-led changes in existing services, some consumers, more often than not from older generations, are uncomfortable with chatbots due to their limited understanding, making it obvious that their requests are being dealt with by machines."
18,Chatbot,125,How are malicious chatbots commonly used?,"Malicious chatbots are frequently used to fill chat rooms with spam and advertisements, by mimicking human behavior and conversations or to entice people into revealing personal information, such as bank account numbers."
19,Predictive analytics,126,How does predictive modeling help businesses?,"In business, predictive models exploit patterns found in historical and transactional data to identify risks and opportunities. "
19,Predictive analytics,127,What are the three properties of big data?,"Gartner's definition of big data is useful in explaining the defining properties of big data: ""Big data is high-volume, high-velocity and/or high variety information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing that enable enhanced insight, decision making, and process automation."" These properties are sometimes referred to as the 3 Vs of big data."
19,Predictive analytics,128,What are ARIMA models and how do they work?,"ARIMA models are a common example of time series models. These models use autoregression, which means the model can be fitted with a regression software that will use machine learning to do most of the regression analysis and smoothing. "
19,Predictive analytics,129,Explain single moving average.,"Single moving average methods utilize smaller and smaller numbered sets of past data to decrease error that is associated with taking a single average, making it a more accurate average than it would be to take the average of the entire data set."
19,Predictive analytics,130,Describe time series model.,"Time series models are a subset of machine learning that utilize time series in order to understand and forecast data using past values. A time series is the sequence of a variable's value over equally spaced periods, such as years or quarters in business applications."
19,Predictive analytics,131,What are the STAR methods for analytical review and how do they operate?,"The STAR methods operate using regression analysis, and fall into two methods. The first is the STAR monthly balance approach, and the conditional expectations made and regression analysis used are both tied to one month being audited. The other method is the STAR annual balance approach, which happens on a larger scale by basing the conditional expectations and regression analysis on one year being audited. Besides the difference in the time being audited, both methods operate the same, by comparing expected and reported balances to determine which accounts to further investigate."
20,Sustainability reporting,132,what is sustainable reporting,"Sustainability reporting refers to the disclosure, whether voluntary, solicited, or required, of non-financial performance information to outsiders of the organization."
20,Sustainability reporting,133,what does sustainability reporting deals with,"Sustainability reporting deals with information concerning environmental, social, economic and governance issues in the broadest sense."
20,Sustainability reporting,134,what are the main benefits of the sustainable reporting,Sustainability reports help companies build consumer confidence and improve corporate reputations through social responsibility programs and transparent risk management.
20,Sustainability reporting,135,who regulates the mandatory practice of sustainable reporting for certain companies in EU,"In the EU, the mandatory practice of sustainability reporting for certain companies is regulated by the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), recently revised and renamed Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)."
20,Sustainability reporting,136,what is Freeman's theory,"the company's shareholders are no longer the only ones to be considered, but also its employees, customers, suppliers, local communities, governments: the society in the broadest sense."
20,Sustainability reporting,137,what is the main downside of the sustainablility reporting ,"while companies can refer to the reporting framework that best fits their industry and organization, this freedom implies a lack of standardization that hinders the effectiveness of the sustainability reporting concept and the multiplication of reporting frameworks makes published information more difficult to interpret in the markets, taking sustainability reporting away from its main objective of transparency and comparison between firmsâ€™ performance."
21,Corporate social responsibility,138,what is Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR),"Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) or Social Impact is a form of international private business self-regulation which aims to contribute to societal goals of a philanthropic, activist, or charitable nature by engaging in, with, or supporting professional service volunteering through pro bono programs, community development, administering monetary grants to non-profit organizations for the public benefit, or to conduct ethically oriented business and investment practices."
21,Corporate social responsibility,139,what is the main benefit of CSR from a strategic perspective,"From a strategic perspective, CSR can contribute to firm profits, particularly if brands voluntarily self-report both the positive and negative outcomes of their endeavors."

28,Avalanche,196,What are some characteristics of slab avalanches?,They have the characteristic appearance of a block (slab) of snow cut out from its surroundings by fractures
28,Avalanche,197,What are the elements of a slab avalanche?,"Elements of slab avalanches include the following: a crown fracture at the top of the start zone, flank fractures on the sides of the start zones, and a fracture at the bottom called the stauchwall."
28,Avalanche,198,How do explosives work to prevent avalanches and how are they delivered?,"Explosives are used extensively to prevent avalanches, by triggering smaller avalanches that break down instabilities in the snowpack, and removing overburden that can result in larger avalanches. Explosive charges are delivered by a number of methods including hand-tossed charges, helicopter-dropped bombs, Gazex concussion lines, and ballistic projectiles launched by air cannons and artillery."
28,Avalanche,199,How are snow net barriers constructed and anchored?,One kind of barrier (snow net) uses a net strung between poles that are anchored byÊguy wiresÊin addition to their foundations. These barriers are similar to those used forÊrockslides.
28,Avalanche,200,What are avalanche dams made of and how do they work?,"landscaped barriers, calledÊavalanche damsÊstop or deflect avalanches with their weight and strength. These barriers are made out of concrete, rocks, or earth. They are usually placed right above the structure, road, or railway that they are trying to protect, although they can also be used to channel avalanches into other barriers."
28,Avalanche,201,"What is the effect of warm, wet snowpacks on the likelihood of death by asphyxia in the event of an avalanche burial?","The warm, wet snowpacks that are likely to increase in frequency due to climate change may also make avalanche burials more deadly. Warm snow has a higher moisture content and is therefore denser than colder snow. Denser avalanche debris decreases the ability for a buried person to breath and the amount of time they have before they run out of oxygen. This increases the likelihood of death by asphyxia in the event of a burial.ÊAdditionally, the predicted thinner snowpacks may increase the frequency of injuries due to trauma, such as a buried skier striking a rock or tree."

29,Cyclone,210,How can a tropical cyclone become extratropical?,ÊA tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses.ÊA tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.
29,Cyclone,211,How were polar lows first identified?,"Polar lows were first identified on the meteorological satellite imagery that became available in the 1960s, which revealed many small-scale cloud vortices at high latitudes."
30,Flood,212,What is a flood?,AÊfloodÊis an overflow of water (or rarely other fluids) that submerges land that is usually dry.
30,Flood,213,What determines the flow at downstream locations during a flood?,"The amount, location, and timing of water reaching a drainage channel from natural precipitation and controlled or uncontrolled reservoir releases determines the flow at downstream locations."

31,Sinkhole,228,What happens to the soil that was covering the dissolved rock?,Soil settles down into the enlarged openings forming a small depression at the ground surface.
31,Sinkhole,229,How are cover-subsidence sinkholes formed?,Cover-subsidence sinkholes form where voids in the underlying limestone allow more settling of the soil to create larger surface depressions.
31,Sinkhole,230,Which activities can accelerate sinkhole collapses according to the text?,"Activities that can accelerate sinkhole collapses include timber removal, ditching, laying pipelines, sewers, water lines, storm drains, and drilling. These activities can increase the downward movement of water beyond the natural rate ofÊgroundwater recharge.__ÊThe increased runoff from the impervious surfaces of roads, roofs, and parking lots also accelerate man-induced sinkhole collapses."
31,Sinkhole,231,What caused the 2010 Guatemala City sinkhole?,TheÊ2010 Guatemala City sinkholeÊformed suddenly in May of that year; torrential rains fromÊTropical Storm AgathaÊand a bad drainage system were blamed for its creation.

They can also flare up unexpectedly and ignite nearby flammable material."
32,Wildfire,236,What are the necessary elements that must come together for a wildfire to occur?,Wildfires occur when all the necessary elements of a fire triangle come together in a susceptible area: an ignition source is brought into contact with a combustible material such asÊvegetationÊthat is subjected to enough heat and has an adequate supply of oxygen from the ambient air.
32,Wildfire,237,What is a wildfire front?,"A wildfireÊfrontÊis the portion sustaining continuous flaming combustion, where unburned material meets active flames, or theÊsmolderingÊtransition between unburned and burned material."
32,Wildfire,238,How far can spot fires occur from the main fire front during Australian bushfires?,"InÊAustralian bushfires, spot fires are known to occur as far as 20 kilometres (12Êmi) from the fire front."
32,Wildfire,239,"What are the types of pollutants released into the atmosphere by wildfires, and how do they affect the environment?","Wildfires release large amounts of carbon dioxide, black and brown carbon particles, and ozone precursors such asÊvolatile organic compoundsÊandÊnitrogen oxides (NOx)Êinto the atmosphere.ÊThese emissions affect radiation, clouds, and climate on regional and even global scales."
32,Wildfire,240,"How do the emissions from wildfires impact air quality across local, regional, and global scales?","While direct emissions of harmful pollutants can affect first responders and local residents, wildfire smoke can also be transported over long distances and impact air quality across local, regional, and global scales.Ê"
32,Wildfire,241,What factors determine whether transported smoke plumes are relevant for surface air quality?,"Whether transported smoke plumes are relevant for surface air quality depends on where they exist in the atmosphere, which in turn depends on the initial injection height of the convective smoke plume into the atmosphere. Smoke that is injected above theÊplanetary boundary layerÊ(PBL) may be detectable from spaceborne satellites and play a role in altering the Earth's energy budget, but would not mix down to the surface where it would impact air quality and human health. Alternatively, smoke confined to a shallow PBL (through nighttime stable stratification of the atmosphere or terrain trapping) may become particularly concentrated and problematic for surface air quality."
33,Volcano,242,What causes volcanoes to form on Earth?,"AÊvolcanoÊis a rupture in theÊcrustÊof aÊplanetary-mass object, such asÊEarth, that allows hotÊlava,Êvolcanic ash, andÊgasesÊto escape from aÊmagma chamberÊbelow the surface."

33,Volcano,244,How do volcanic eruptions impact the environment and human populations?,"Large eruptions can affect atmospheric temperature as ash and droplets ofÊsulfuric acidÊobscure the Sun and cool the Earth'sÊtroposphere. Historically, large volcanic eruptions have been followed byÊvolcanic wintersÊwhich have caused catastrophic famines."
33,Volcano,245,What happens at mid-ocean ridges?,"At theÊmid-ocean ridges, twoÊtectonic platesÊdiverge from one another as hot mantle rock creeps upwards beneath the thinnedÊoceanic crust."
33,Volcano,246,How is new oceanic crust formed?,"The decrease of pressure in the rising mantle rock leads toÊadiabaticÊexpansion and theÊpartial meltingÊof the rock, causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust."
33,Volcano,247,What are subduction zones and how are they formed?,"SubductionÊzones are places where two plates, usually an oceanic plate and a continental plate, collide. The oceanic plate subducts (dives beneath the continental plate), forming a deep ocean trench just offshore."
33,Volcano,248,What is flux melting and how does it contribute to the formation of magma in subduction zones?,"In a process calledÊflux melting, water released from the subducting plate lowers the melting temperature of the overlying mantle wedge, thus creatingÊmagma."
33,Volcano,249,What are hotspots and how are they formed?,"HotspotsÊare volcanic areas thought to be formed byÊmantle plumes, which are hypothesized to be columns of hot material rising from the core-mantle boundary."
33,Volcano,250,What is rifting and how does it occur?,Sustained upwelling of hot mantle rock can develop under the interior of a continent and lead to rifting.
33,Volcano,251,What are failed rifts and how are they characterized?,"However, rifting often fails to completely split the continental lithosphere (such as in anÊaulacogen), and failed rifts are characterized by volcanoes that erupt unusualÊalkali lavaÊorÊcarbonatites."

34,Famine,256,What is the conventional explanation for the cause of famines prior to 1981 and what was its assumption?,The conventional explanation until 1981 for the cause of famines was the Food availability decline (FAD) hypothesis. The assumption was that the central cause of all famines was a decline in food availability.
34,Famine,257,"What is the ""failure of exchange entitlements"" (FEE) theory and how does it explain the causation of famines?","famines are a result of entitlements, the theory being proposed is called the ""failure of exchange entitlements"" or FEE. A person may own various commodities that can be exchanged in a market economy for the other commodities he or she needs. The exchange can happen via trading or production or through a combination of the two. These entitlements are called trade-based or production-based entitlements. Per this proposed view, famines are precipitated due to a breakdown in the ability of the person to exchange his entitlements."
34,Famine,258,What is the Malthusian catastrophe and how does it relate to famines?,Thomas Malthus's Essay on the Principle of Population has made popular the theory of the Malthusian catastropheÑthat many famines are caused by imbalance of food production compared to the large populations of countries[170] whose population exceeds the regional carrying capacity.
34,Famine,259,Who refutes the Malthusian theory of famines and what alternative explanation do they propose?,"Professor Alex de Waal, executive director of the World Peace Foundation,Êrefutes the Malthus theory, looking instead to political factors as major causes of recent (over the last 150 years) famines."
34,Famine,260,What were some historical causes of famines in Europe during the Middle Ages?,"Changing weather patterns, the ineffectiveness of medieval governments in dealing with crises, wars, andÊepidemic diseasesÊsuch as theÊBlack DeathÊhelped to cause hundreds of famines in Europe during theÊMiddle Ages, including 95 in Britain and 75 in France."
34,Famine,261,Can a local crop failure cause a famine?,A local crop failure does not cause a famine unless there is also a lack of money to buy food from elsewhere.
35,Tsunami,262,What is a tsunami?,"A tsunami (/(t)su__n__mi, (t)s__-/ (t)soo-NAH-mee, (t)suu-; from Japanese: __, lit._'harbour wave', pronounced [ts_nami]) is a series of waves in a water body caused by the displacement of a large volume of water, generally in an ocean or aÊlarge lake."
35,Tsunami,263,What causes a tsunami?,"Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions (including detonations, landslides, glacier calvings, meteorite impacts and other disturbances) above or below water all have the potential to generate a tsunami. A tsunami is generated by the displacement of water from a large event."
35,Tsunami,264,What is the impact of tsunami?,"Although the impact of tsunamis is limited to coastal areas, their destructive power can be enormous, and they can affect entire ocean basins."
35,Tsunami,265,What was the impact of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami?,"TheÊ2004 Indian Ocean tsunamiÊwas among the deadliest natural disasters in human history, with at least 230,000 people killed or missing in 14 countries bordering theÊIndian Ocean."
35,Tsunami,266,What is the difference between everyday wind waves and a tsunami in terms of wavelength and speed?,"While everydayÊwind wavesÊhave aÊwavelengthÊ(from crest to crest) of about 100 metres (330Êft) and a height of roughly 2 metres (6.6Êft), a tsunami in the deep ocean has a much larger wavelength of up to 200 kilometres (120Êmi). Such a wave travels at well over 800 kilometres per hour (500Êmph), but owing to the enormous wavelength the wave oscillation at any given point takes 20 or 30 minutes to complete a cycle and has an amplitude of only about 1 metre (3.3Êft).ÊThis makes tsunamis difficult to detect over deep water, where ships are unable to feel their passage."
35,Tsunami,267,"Why do some countries experience more tsunamis than others, even if they are geographically close to each other?","About 80% of tsunamis occur in the Pacific Ocean, but they are possible wherever there are large bodies of water, including lakes. However, tsunami interactions with shorelines and the seafloor topography are extremely complex, which leaves some countries more vulnerable than others. For example, the Pacific coasts of the United States and Mexico lie adjacent to each other, but the United States has recorded ten tsunamis in the region since 1788, while Mexico has recorded twenty-five since 1732.ÊSimilarly, Japan has had more than a hundred tsunamis in recorded history, while the neighboring island of Taiwan has registered only two, in 1781 and 1867."
35,Tsunami,268,How long is a typical wave period for a damaging tsunami?,A typical wave period for a damaging tsunami is about twelve minutes.
35,Tsunami,269,"What were the first scales used to measure the intensity of tsunamis, and when were they developed?","The first scales used routinely to measure the intensity of tsunamis were theÊSieberg-AmbraseysÊscaleÊ(1962), used in theÊMediterranean SeaÊand theÊImamura-Iida intensity scaleÊ(1963), used in the Pacific Ocean."
35,Tsunami,270,What is the difference between amplitude and crest-to-trough height in measuring tsunami height?,"Amplitude, Wave Height, or Tsunami Height: Refers to the height of a tsunami relative to the normal sea level at the time of the tsunami, which may be tidal High Water, or Low Water. It is different from the crest-to-trough height which is commonly used to measure other type of wave height."
35,Tsunami,271,What was the direct trigger for the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster?,"TheÊFukushima Daiichi nuclear disasterÊwas directly triggered by theÊ2011 T_hoku earthquake and tsunami, when waves exceeded the height of the plant's sea wall."
36,Tornado,272,What is a tornado?,"A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the Earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or, in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud."
36,Tornado,273,How are tornadoes usually visible?,"Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes, and they are often visible in the form of aÊcondensation funnelÊoriginating from the base of a cumulonimbus cloud, with a cloud of rotatingÊdebrisÊandÊdustÊbeneath it."
36,Tornado,274,What are the typical wind speeds and sizes of most tornadoes?,"Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than 180 kilometers per hour (110 miles per hour), are about 80 meters (250 feet) across, and travel several kilometers (a few miles) before dissipating. TheÊmost extremeÊtornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than 480 kilometers per hour (300Êmph), are more than 3 kilometers (2Êmi) in diameter, and stay on the ground for more than 100Êkm (60 mi)."
36,Tornado,275,What are the types of tornadoes?,"Various types of tornadoes include theÊmultiple vortex tornado,Êlandspout, andÊwaterspout.Ê"
36,Tornado,276,In which parts of the world do tornadoes occur most frequently?,"Tornadoes occur most frequently in North America (particularly in central and southeastern regions of the United States colloquially known as Tornado Alley; the United States and Canada have by far the most tornadoes of any countries in the world). Tornadoes also occur in South Africa, much of Europe (except Spain, most of the Alps, Balkans, and northern Scandinavia), western and eastern Australia, New Zealand, Bangladesh and adjacent eastern India, Japan, the Philippines, and southeastern South America (Uruguay and Argentina)."
36,Tornado,277,How can tornadoes be detected?,"Tornadoes can be detected before or as they occur through the use ofÊpulse-Doppler radarÊby recognizing patterns in velocity and reflectivity data, such asÊhook echoesÊorÊdebris balls, as well as through the efforts ofÊstorm spotters."
36,Tornado,278,How does the Fujita scale rate tornadoes?,TheÊFujita scaleÊrates tornadoes by damage caused and has been replaced in some countries by the updatedÊEnhanced Fujita Scale.Ê
36,Tornado,279,What are the weakest and strongest categories of tornado in the Fujita scale?,"An F0 or EF0 tornado, the weakest category, damages trees, but not substantial structures. AnÊF5 or EF5Êtornado, the strongest category, rips buildings off their foundations and can deform largeÊskyscrapers."
36,Tornado,280,What are the various sounds that tornadoes emit?,"Various sounds of tornadoes have been reported, mostly related to familiar sounds for the witness and generally some variation of a whooshing roar. Popularly reported sounds include a freight train, rushing rapids or waterfall, a nearby jet engine, or combinations of these."
36,Tornado,281,How does the RFD contribute to the formation of a tornado?,"The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an area of low pressure at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, in the form of a visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground."
37,Landslide,282,What is a landslide?,"Landslides, also known as landslips, are several forms of mass wasting that may include a wide range of ground movements, such as rockfalls, shallow or deep-seated slope failures, mudflows, and debris flows."
37,Landslide,283,What causes a landslide?,"Landslides occur when the slope (or a portion of it) undergoes some processes that change its condition from stable to unstable. This is essentially due to a decrease in theÊshear strengthÊof the slope material, an increase in theÊshear stressÊborne by the material, or a combination of the two. A change in the stability of a slope can be caused by a number of factors, acting together or alone."
37,Landslide,284,Which human activities might lead to a landslide?,"Landslides are aggravated by human activities, such as deforestation, cultivation, and construction; vibrations from machinery or traffic; blasting and mining; earthwork (e.g. by altering the shape of a slope, or imposing new loads); in shallow soils, the removal of deep-rooted vegetation that binds colluvium to bedrock; agricultural or forestry activities (logging), and urbanization, which change the amount of water infiltrating the soil; temporal variation in land use and land cover (LULC): it includes the human abandonment of farming areas, e.g. due to the economic and social transformations which occurred in Europe after the Second World War. Land degradation and extreme rainfall can increase the frequency of erosion and landslide phenomena."
37,Landslide,285,What are the natural causes of a landslide?Ê,"ÊNatural causes of landslides include: saturation by rain water infiltration, snow melting, or glaciers melting; rising of groundwater or increase of pore water pressure (e.g. due to aquifer recharge in rainy seasons, or by rain water infiltration); increase of hydrostatic pressure in cracks and fractures; loss or absence of vertical vegetative structure, soil nutrients, and soil structure (e.g. after a wildfire Ð a fire in forests lasting for 3Ð4 days); erosion of the top of a slope by rivers or sea waves; physical and chemical weathering (e.g. by repeated freezing and thawing, heating and cooling, salt leaking in the groundwater or mineral dissolution); ground shaking caused by earthquakes, which can destabilize the slope directly (e.g., by inducing soil liquefaction) or weaken the material and cause cracks that will eventually produce a landslide; volcanic eruptions."
37,Landslide,286,How has the landslide classification scheme evolved overtime?Ê,"In 1978, geologist David Varnes noted this imprecise usage and proposed a new, much tighter scheme for the classification of mass movements and subsidence processes. This scheme was later modified by Cruden and Varnes in 1996, and refined by Hutchinson (1988), Hungr et al. (2001), and finally by Hungr, Leroueil and Picarelli (2014)."
37,Landslide,287,Explain the types of movement associated with a landslide,"A fall is a movement of isolated blocks or chunks of soil in free-fall. The term topple refers to blocks coming away by rotation from a vertical face. A slide is the movement of a body of material that generally remains intact while moving over one or several inclined surfaces or thin layers of material (also called shear zones) in which large deformations are concentrated. Spreads are a form of subsidence, in which a layer of material cracks, opens up, and expands laterally. Flows are the movement of fluidised material, which can be both dry or rich in water (such as in mud flows). An avalanching effect can also be present, in which the moving mass entrains additional material along its path."
37,Landslide,288,What are the sub-classes of slides? Explain.Ê,"Slides are also sub-classified by the form of the surface(s) or shear zone(s) on which movement happens. The planes may be broadly parallel to the surface (""planar slides"") or spoon-shaped (""rotational slides""). Slides can occur catastrophically, but movement on the surface can also be gradual and progressive."
37,Landslide,289,What are deep-seated landslides and how to identify them?,"Deep-seated landslides are those in which the sliding surface is mostly deeply located, for instance well below the maximum rooting depth of trees. They usually involve deep regolith, weathered rock, and/or bedrock and include large slope failures associated with translational, rotational, or complex movements. They tend to form along a plane of weakness such as a fault or bedding plane. They can be visually identified by concave scarps at the top and steep areas at the toe."
37,Landslide,290,What are shallow landslides and how do they occur?,"A landslide in which the sliding surface is located within theÊsoilÊmantle orÊweatheredÊbedrockÊ(typically to a depth from few decimeters to some meters) is called a shallow landslide. Debris slides andÊdebris flowsÊare usually shallow. Shallow landslides can often happen in areas that have slopes with high permeable soils on top of low permeable soils. The low permeable soil traps the water in the shallower soil generating high water pressures. As the top soil is filled with water, it can become unstable and slide downslope."
37,Landslide,291,How does landslides occurring undersea relate to tsunamis?,"Landslides that occur undersea, or have impact into water e.g. significant rockfall or volcanic collapse into the sea,Êcan generateÊtsunamis.38"
38,"Environmental,social and corporate governance",292,how ESG data can be useful for the investors,"Investors may also use ESG data beyond assessing material risks to the organization in their evaluation of enterprise value, specifically by designing models based on assumptions that the identification, assessment and management of sustainability-related risks and opportunities in respect to all organizational stakeholders leads to higher long-term risk-adjusted return."
38,"Environmental,social and corporate governance",293,what is corporate governance,Corporate governance is the structures and processes that direct and control companies.
38,"Environmental,social and corporate governance",294,what is the main function of the corporate governance,It makes companies more accountable and transparent to investors and gives them the tools to respond to stakeholder concerns.
38,"Environmental,social and corporate governance",295,what is equator principles,"The Equator Principles is a risk management framework, adopted by financial institutions, for determining, assessing and managing environmental and social risk in project finance."
38,"Environmental,social and corporate governance",296,what was the primary purpose for the equator principles,It is primarily intended to provide a minimum standard for due diligence to support responsible risk decision-making.
39,Sustainable development goals,297,what is meant by sustainable development goals (SDGs),"The Sustainable Development Goals or Global Goals are a collection of seventeen interlinked objectives designed to serve as a ""shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future""."
39,Sustainable development goals,298,what are the seventeen interlinked objectives of sustainable development goals (SDGs),"The SDGs are: no poverty; zero hunger; good health and well-being; quality education; gender equality; clean water and sanitation; affordable and clean energy; decent work and economic growth; industry, innovation and infrastructure; reduced inequalities; sustainable cities and communities; responsible consumption and production; climate action; life below water; life on land; peace, justice, and strong institutions; and partnerships for the goals."
39,Sustainable development goals,299,when and why sustainable development goals (SDGs) were formulated,"The SDGs were formulated in 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) as part of the Post-2015 Development Agenda, which sought to create a future global development framework to succeed the Millennium Development Goals, which ended that year."
39,Sustainable development goals,300,what is SDG 1,"SDG 1 is to: ""End poverty in all its forms everywhere"". The goal has seven targets and 13 indicators to measure progress out of which the five outcome targets are: eradication of extreme poverty; reduction of all poverty by half; implementation of social protection systems; ensuring equal rights to ownership, basic services, technology and economic resources; and the building of resilience to environmental, economic and social disasters."
39,Sustainable development goals,301,what is SDG 2 ,"SDG 2 is to: ""End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture"". SDG 2 has eight targets and 14 indicators to measure progress out of which the five outcome targets are: ending hunger and improving access to food; ending all forms of malnutrition; agricultural productivity; sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices; and genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals; investments, research and technology."
39,Sustainable development goals,302,what are the three aspects which needs to come togather to achieve sustainable development,"To achieve sustainable development, three aspects or dimensions need to come together: The economic, socio-political, and environmental dimensions are all critically important and interdependent."
39,Sustainable development goals,303,what are the primary flaws in the design of the SDGs ,"Scholars have pointed out flaws in the design of the SDGs for the following aspects: ""the number of goals, the structure of the goal framework (for example, the non-hierarchical structure), the coherence between the goals, the specificity or measurability of the targets, the language used in the text, and their reliance on neoliberal economic development-oriented sustainable development as their core orientation""."
40,Balanced scorecard,304,what is balanced scorecard,"A balanced scorecard is a strategy performance management tool â€“ a well structured report, that can be used by managers to keep track of the execution of activities by the staff within their control and to monitor the consequences arising from these actions."
40,Balanced scorecard,305,what are the critical characteristics of a balanced score card ,"The critical characteristics that define a Balanced Scorecard are: its focus on the strategic agenda of the organization/coalition concerned; a focused set of measurements to monitor performance against objectives; a mix of financial and non-financial data items (originally divided into four ""perspectives"" - Financial, Customer, Internal Process, and Learning & Growth); and, a portfolio of initiatives designed to impact performance of the measures/objectives."
40,Balanced scorecard,306,what was the initial purpose of a balanced scorecard ,"Balanced Scorecard was initially proposed as a general purpose performance management system. Subsequently, it was promoted specifically as an approach to strategic performance management."
40,Balanced scorecard,307,what are the primary uses of modern balanced scorecard ,"Two of the ideas that underpin modern balanced scorecard designs concern making it easier to select which data to observe, and ensuring that the choice of data is consistent with the ability of the observer to intervene."
40,Balanced scorecard,308,how doesbalanced scorecard contribute different organisations in their strategy making decisions,"The balanced scorecard indirectly also provides a useful insight into an organisation's strategy by requiring general strategic statements (e.g. mission, vision) to be precipitated into more specific/tangible forms."
40,Balanced scorecard,309,what is meant by design of a balanced scorecard,"Design of a balanced scorecard is about the identification of a small number of financial and non-financial measures and attaching targets to them, so that when they are reviewed it is possible to determine whether current performance 'meets expectations' and by alerting managers to areas where performance deviates from expectations, they can be encouraged to focus their attention on these areas, and hopefully as a result trigger improved performance within the part of the organization they lead."
40,Balanced scorecard,310,what are the four major required steps to design a balanced scorecard mentioned in the Kaplan & Norton's writing ,"This is illustrated well by the four steps required to design a balanced scorecard included in Kaplan & Norton's writing on the subject in the late 1990s: 1)  Translating the vision into operational goals; 2)  Communicating the vision and link it to individual performance; 3)  Business planning; index setting; 4)  Feedback and learning, and adjusting the strategy accordingly."
40,Balanced scorecard,311,does a balanced scorecard alone has any role in the formation of business strategy ,"Although it helps focus managers' attention on strategic issues and the management of the implementation of strategy, it is important to remember that the balanced scorecard itself has no role in the formation of strategy. In fact, balanced scorecards can co-exist with strategic planning systems and other tools."
40,Balanced scorecard,312,what were the four perspectives used in the first generation balanced scorecard ,"The original four ""perspectives"" proposed were: Financial: encourages the identification of a few relevant high-level financial measures. In particular, designers were encouraged to choose measures that helped inform the answer to the question ""How do we look to shareholders?"" Examples: cash flow, sales growth, operating income, return on equity; Customer: encourages the identification of measures that answer the question ""What is important to our customers and stakeholders?"" Examples: percent of sales from new products, on time delivery, share of important customersâ€™ purchases, ranking by important customers; Internal business processes: encourages the identification of measures that answer the question ""What must we excel at?""Examples: cycle time, unit cost, yield, new product introductions; Learning and growth: encourages the identification of measures that answer the question ""How can we continue to improve, create value and innovate?"". Examples: time to develop new generation of products, life cycle to product maturity, time to market versus competition;"
40,Balanced scorecard,313,what modifications were introduced in the second generation balanced scorecard ,"In this modified version of balanced scorecard design, managers select a few strategic objectives within each of the perspectives, and then define the cause-effect chain among these objectives by drawing links between them to create a ""strategic linkage model""."
40,Balanced scorecard,314,what were the primary problems with the design of the second generation balanced scorecard ,"One problem with the ""second generation"" design approach described above was that the plotting of causal links amongst twenty or so medium-term strategic goals was still a relatively abstract activity and in practice it ignored the fact that opportunities to intervene to influence strategic goals are (and need to be) anchored in current and real management activity. Secondly, the need to ""roll forward"" and test the impact of these goals necessitated the reference to an additional design instrument: a statement of what ""strategic success"", or the ""strategic end-state"", looked like (which in turn would be related to the organisation's Mission or Vision Statement)."
40,Balanced scorecard,315,what improvements were introduced in the third generation balanced scorecard over the second generation ,"Third generation balanced scorecards improved the utility of second generation of balanced scorecards, giving more relevance and functionality to strategic objectives. The major difference is the incorporation of Destination Statements. Other key components are strategic objectives, strategic linkage model and perspectives, measures and initiatives."
41,Sustainability accounting ,316,what is sustainability accounting ,"Sustainability accounting (also known as social accounting, social and environmental accounting, corporate social reporting, corporate social responsibility reporting, or non-financial reporting) was originated about 20 years ago[1] and is considered a subcategory of financial accounting that focuses on the disclosure of non-financial information about a firm's performance to external stakeholders, such as capital holders, creditors, and other authorities."

41,Sustainability accounting ,319,what are the basic requirements for the analytical frameworks of sustaiability accounting ,"Various types of frameworks are being used nowadays depending on the purpose of measurement. These frameworks seek to: Integrate the economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainable development; Have sound foundations and to maintain key information needed to improve sustainable development measurements; Clarify relationships between different indicators and policies;"
41,Sustainability accounting ,320,what are two different approaches offered by OECD on sustainability accounting ,The OECD offers two different approaches to the accounting framework for sustainability accounting: 1) Measuring environmental-economic-social interrelationships; 2) Wealth-based approaches.
41,Sustainability accounting ,321,what are the specific techniques to measure information in sustainability accounting,"Specific techniques to measure information in sustainability accounting: 1) Inventory Approach, 2) Sustainable Cost Approach, 3) Resource Flow/Input-Output Approach."
41,Sustainability accounting ,322,how does inventory approach work to measure information in sustainability reporting ,"The Inventory Approach focuses on the different categories of natural capital and their consumption and/or enhancement. This approach identifies, records, monitors, and then reports on these different categories. These categories are analyzed according to specific classifications, including critical, non-renewable/nonsubstitutable, non-renewable/substitutable, and renewable natural capital."
41,Sustainability accounting ,323,how does sustainable cost approach work to measure information in sustainability reporting ,"The Sustainable Cost Approach results in a notional amount on the income statement that quantifies the organization's failure to ""leave the biosphere at the end of the accounting period no worse off than it was at the beginning of the accounting period"".[19] In other words, this amount represents how much it would cost an organization to return the biosphere to its natural state at the beginning of the accounting period."
41,Sustainability accounting ,324,how does resource flow or input-output approach work to measure information in sustainability reporting ,"The Resource Flow/Input-Output Approach attempts to report the resource flows of the organization. Rather than explicitly reporting sustainability, it focuses on resources used to provide transparency. This approach catalogues the resources flowing into and out of the organization to pinpoint potential areas of improvement."
41,Sustainability accounting ,325,what are the primary motivations to practise sustainability reporting ,"There are six main motivations for practicing sustainability accounting: 1) Greenwashing; 2) Mimicry and industry pressure; 3) Legislative pressure; 4) Stakeholder pressure and ensuring the ""license to operate""; 5) Self-regulation, corporate responsibility and ethical reasons; 6) Managing the business case for sustainability."
42,Greenwasing ,326,what is greenwashing,"Greenwashing (a compound word modeled on ""whitewash""), also called ""green sheen"", is a form of advertising or marketing spin in which green PR and green marketing are deceptively used to persuade the public that an organization's products, aims and policies are environmentally friendly."
42,Greenwasing ,327,To what extent greenwashing can be used ,Greenwashing can range from changing the name or label of a product to evoke the natural environment (for example on a product containing harmful chemicals) to multimillion-dollar campaigns that portray highly-polluting energy companies as eco-friendly.
42,Greenwasing ,328,why greenwashing is being used by many corporations ,Many corporations use greenwashing to improve public perception of their brands and complex corporate structures can further obscure the big picture.
42,Greenwasing ,329,"what are the ""seven sins of greenwashing"" addressed by the TerraChoice which is an environmental consulting division of UL to ""help consumers identify products that made misleading environmental claims""","TerraChoice, an environmental consulting division of UL, described ""seven sins of greenwashing"" in 2007 to ""help consumers identify products that made misleading environmental claims"": 1) Hidden Trade-off: a claim that a product is ""green"" based on an unreasonably narrow set of attributes without attention to other important environmental issues; 2) No Proof: a claim that cannot be substantiated by easily accessible information or by a reliable third-party certification; 3) Vagueness: a claim that is so poorly defined or broad that its real meaning is likely to be misunderstood by the consumer. ""All-natural"", for example, is not necessarily ""green""; 4) Worshiping False Labels: a claim that, through words or images, gives the impression of a third-party endorsement where none exists; 5) rrelevance: a claim that may be truthful but which is unimportant or unhelpful to consumers seeking environmentally-preferable products; 6) Lesser of Two Evils: a claim that may be true within the product category, but that risks distracting consumers from the greater environmental impact of the category as a whole; 7) Fibbing: a claim that is simply false."
42,Greenwasing ,330,how did the term 'greenwashing' come,"The term greenwashing was coined by New York environmentalist Jay Westerveld in a 1986 essay about the hotel industry's practice of placing notices in bedrooms promoting reuse of towels to ""save the environment"" and he noted that often little or no effort toward reducing energy waste was made by these institutions, although towel reuse saved them laundry costs."
43,Resource Depletion,331,what is resource depletion?,Resource depletion is the consumption of a resource faster than it can be replenished.
43,Resource Depletion,332,what are types of Natural Resources?,Natural resources are commonly divided between renewable resources and non-renewable resources(see also mineral resource classification).
43,Resource Depletion,333,what will be the consequences of using access of both the renewable resources?, Use of either of these forms of resources beyond their rate of replacement is considered to be resource depletion.
43,Resource Depletion,334,what are the values of renewable resources?,"The value of a resource is a direct result of its availability in nature and the cost of extracting the resource, the more a resource is depleted the more the value of the resource increases."
43,Resource Depletion,335,what are the types of resource depletion?,"There are several types of resource depletion, the most known being: Aquifer depletion, deforestation, mining for fossil fuels and minerals, pollution or contamination of resources, slash-and-burn agricultural practices, soil erosion, and overconsumption, excessive or unnecessary use of resources."
44,Depletion Accounting,336,What is depletion accounting and how does it relate to natural resources?,"In an effort to offset the depletion of resources, theorists have come up with the concept of depletion accounting."
44,Depletion Accounting,337,How do theorists propose to account for nature's value on an equal footing with the market economy?,"Better known as 'green accounting,' depletion accounting aims to account for nature's value on an equal footing with the market economy."
44,Depletion Accounting,338,"What data is used in depletion accounting, and how is it collected?",Resource depletion accounting uses data provided from countries to estimate the adjustments needed due to their use and depletion of the natural capital available to them.
44,Depletion Accounting,339,What factors are considered in depletion accounting?,"Depletion accounting factors in several different influences such as the number of years until resource exhaustion, the cost of resource extraction and the demand of the resource."
44,Depletion Accounting,340,Why do resource extraction industries in developing countries contribute to higher levels of resource depletion and environmental degradation?,"Resource extraction industries make up a large part of the economic activity in developing countries,  leads to higher levels of resource depletion and environmental degradation in developing countries."
44,Depletion Accounting,341,"What is the social value of natural resources and ecosystems, and how is it measured?","Measurement of social value is sought through ecosystem services, which are defined as the benefits of nature to households, communities and economies."
44,Depletion Accounting,342,What are some potential challenges to implementing depletion accounting in developing countries?,Resource extraction industries make up a large part of the economic activity in developing countries.
45,Importance of Depletion Accounting,343,How can depletion accounting be used to track the use of natural resources over time and hold governments accountable for their resource usage?,"Environmentalists are interested in depletion accounting as a way to track the use of natural resources over time, hold governments accountable or compare their environmental conditions to those of another country."
45,Importance of Depletion Accounting,344,In what ways can economists use depletion accounting to understand the financial reliance of countries or corporations on non-renewable resources?,"Economists want to measure resource depletion to understand how financially reliant countries or corporations are on non-renewable resources, whether this use can be sustained and the financial drawbacks of switching to renewable resources in light of the depleting resources"
45,Importance of Depletion Accounting,345,"How can depletion accounting be used to encourage more sustainable practices among businesses and governments, and what role does transparency play in this process?","Economists want to measure resource depletion to understand how financially reliant countries or corporations are on non-renewable resources, whether this use can be sustained and the financial drawbacks of switching to renewable resources in light of the depleting resources"
46,Issues of Depletion Accounting,346,"What is depletion accounting, and why is it considered complex to implement?","Depletion accounting is complex to implement as nature is not as quantifiable as cars, houses, or bread."

The larger batteries in these vehicles power the car's electronics, allowing the engine to shut off and avoid prolonged idling."
55,Fuel efficiency,437,What is specific energy content in fuel?,"The specific energy content of a fuel is the heat energy obtained when a certain quantity is burned (such as a gallon, litre, kilogram). It is sometimes called the heat of combustion. There exists two different values of specific heat energy for the same batch of fuel. One is the high (or gross) heat of combustion and the other is the low (or net) heat of combustion. The high value is obtained when, after the combustion, the water in the exhaust is in liquid form. For the low value, the exhaust has all the water in vapor form (steam). Since water vapor gives up heat energy when it changes from vapor to liquid, the liquid water value is larger since it includes the latent heat of vaporization of water. The difference between the high and low values is significant, about 8 or 9%. This accounts for most of the apparent discrepancy in the heat value of gasoline. In the U.S. (and the table) the high heat values have traditionally been used, but in many other countries, the low heat values are commonly used."

55,Fuel efficiency,440,How do European-built cars compare to US vehicles in terms of fuel efficiency?,"European-built cars are generally more fuel-efficient than US vehicles. While Europe has many higher efficiency diesel cars, European gasoline vehicles are on average also more efficient than gasoline-powered vehicles in the USA. Most European vehicles cited in the CSI study run on diesel engines, which tend to achieve greater fuel efficiency than gas engines. Selling those cars in the United States is difficult because of emission standards, notes Walter McManus, a fuel economy expert at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. ""For the most part, European diesels don’t meet U.S. emission standards"", McManus said in 2007. Another reason why many European models are not marketed in the United States is that labor unions object to having the big 3 import any new foreign built models regardless of fuel economy while laying off workers at home."

55,Fuel efficiency,442,What is the common distribution of a flame under normal gravity conditions and why does it occur?,"The common distribution of a flame under normal gravity conditions depends on convection, because soot tends to rise to the top of a flame, such as in a candle, making the flame yellow. In microgravity or zero gravity, such as an environment in outer space, convection no longer occurs, and the flame becomes spherical, with a tendency to become more blue and more efficient. There are several possible explanations for this difference, of which the most likely one given is the hypothesis that the temperature is evenly distributed enough that soot is not formed and complete combustion occurs., National Aeronautics and Space Administration, April 2005. Experiments by NASA in microgravity reveal that diffusion flames in microgravity allow more soot to be completely oxidised after they are produced than diffusion flames on Earth, because of a series of mechanisms that behaved differently in microgravity when compared to normal gravity conditions.LSP-1 experiment results, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, April 2005. Premixed flames in microgravity burn at a much slower rate and more efficiently than even a candle on Earth, and last much longer."

57,Latent Heat ,444,What is latent heat?,"Latent heat (also known as latent energy or heat of transformation) is energy released or absorbed, by a body or a thermodynamic system, during a constant-temperature process — usually a first-order phase transition."
57,Latent Heat ,445,How does latent heat differ from sensible heat?,"In contrast to latent heat, sensible heat is energy transferred as heat, with a resultant temperature change in a body."
57,Latent Heat ,446,"Who introduced the term ""latent heat,"" and in what context was it used?",The term was introduced around 1762 by Scottish chemist Joseph Black. It is derived from the Latin latere (to lie hidden). Black used the term in the context of calorimetry where a heat transfer caused a volume change in a body while its temperature was constant.
57,Latent Heat ,447,What is the difference between sensible heat and latent heat?,"The terms ?sensible heat? and ?latent heat? refer to energy transferred between a body and its surroundings, defined by the occurrence or non-occurrence of temperature change; they depend on the properties of the body. ?Sensible heat? is ?sensed? or felt in a process as a change in the body's temperature. ?Latent heat? is energy transferred in a process without change of the body's temperature, for example, in a phase change (solid/liquid/gas)."
57,Latent Heat ,448,How is sensible heat sensed or felt in a process?,"The terms ?sensible heat? and ?latent heat? refer to energy transferred between a body and its surroundings, defined by the occurrence or non-occurrence of temperature change; they depend on the properties of the body. ?Sensible heat? is ?sensed? or felt in a process as a change in the body's temperature. ?Latent heat? is energy transferred in a process without change of the body's temperature, for example, in a phase change (solid/liquid/gas)."
57,Latent Heat ,449,What is the association between latent heat and atmospheric or ocean water?,"Both sensible and latent heats are observed in many processes of transfer of energy in nature. Latent heat is associated with the change of phase of atmospheric or ocean water, vaporization, condensation, freezing or melting, whereas sensible heat is energy transferred that is evident in change of the temperature of the atmosphere or ocean, or ice, without those phase changes, though it is associated with changes of pressure and volume."
57,Latent Heat ,450,What are the two common forms of latent heat?,"When a body is heated at constant temperature by thermal radiation in a microwave field for example, it may expand by an amount described by its latent heat with respect to volume or latent heat of expansion, or increase its pressure by an amount described by its latent heat with respect to pressure.Latent heat is energy released or absorbed, by a body or a thermodynamic system, during a constant-temperature process. Two common forms of latent heat are latent heat of fusion (melting) and latent heat of vaporization (boiling). These names describe the direction of energy flow when changing from one phase to the next: from solid to liquid, and liquid to gas."
57,Latent Heat ,451,What happens to the latent energy absorbed during evaporation when vapor condenses to a liquid on a surface?,"If the vapor then condenses to a liquid on a surface, then the vapor's latent energy absorbed during evaporation is released as the liquid's sensible heat onto the surface."
57,Latent Heat ,452,Why is steam a more effective heating medium than boiling water?,"The large value of the enthalpy of condensation of water vapor is the reason that steam is a far more effective heating medium than boiling water, and is more hazardous."
57,Latent Heat ,453,What is latent heat flux in meteorology?,"In meteorology, latent heat flux is the flux of energy from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere that is associated with evaporation or transpiration of water at the surface and subsequent condensation of water vapor in the troposphere. It is an important component of Earth's surface energy budget. Latent heat flux has been commonly measured with the Bowen ratio technique, or more recently since the mid-1900s by the eddy covariance method."
57,Latent Heat ,454,How did James Prescott Joule characterize latent energy and sensible heat?,"Later, James Prescott Joule characterised latent energy as the energy of interaction in a given configuration of particles, i.e. a form of potential energy, and the sensible heat as an energy that was indicated by the thermometer,relating the latter to thermal energy."
57,Latent Heat ,455,How is latent heat flux  measured?,"In meteorology, latent heat flux is the flux of energy from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere that is associated with evaporation or transpiration of water at the surface and subsequent condensation of water vapor in the troposphere. It is an important component of Earth's surface energy budget. Latent heat flux has been commonly measured with the Bowen ratio technique, or more recently since the mid-1900s by the eddy covariance method."
58,Sublimation (phase transition),456,What is deposition or desublimation?,"Sublimation is the transition of a substance directly from the solid to the gas state,without passing through the liquid state.Sublimation is an endothermic process that occurs at temperatures and pressures below a substance's triple point in its phase diagram, which corresponds to the lowest pressure at which the substance can exist as a liquid. The reverse process of sublimation is deposition or desublimation, in which a substance passes directly from a gas to a solid phase.Sublimation has also been used as a generic term to describe a solid-to-gas transition (sublimation) followed by a gas-to-solid transition (deposition).While vaporization from liquid to gas occurs as evaporation from the surface if it occurs below the boiling point of the liquid, and as boiling with formation of bubbles in the interior of the liquid if it occurs at the boiling point, there is no such distinction for the solid-to-gas transition which always occurs as sublimation from the surface."
58,Sublimation (phase transition),457,"Under what conditions can any solid sublimate, and why is sublimation easier than evaporation from the melt for some substances such as carbon and arsenic?","At normal pressures, most chemical compounds and elements possess three different states at different temperatures. In these cases, the transition from the solid to the gaseous state requires an intermediate liquid state. The pressure referred to is the partial pressure of the substance, not the total (e.g. atmospheric) pressure of the entire system. Thus, any solid can sublimate if its vapour pressure is higher than the surrounding partial pressure of the same substance, and in some cases sublimates at an appreciable rate (e.g. water ice just below 0 °C). For some substances, such as carbon and arsenic, sublimation is much easier than evaporation from the melt, because the pressure of their triple point is very high, and it is difficult to obtain them as liquids."
58,Sublimation (phase transition),458,What is naphthalene and where is it commonly found?,"Naphthalene, an organic compound commonly found in pesticides such as mothballs, sublimes easily because it is made of non-polar molecules that are held together only by van der Waals intermolecular forces. Naphthalene is a solid that sublimes at standard atmospheric temperature with the sublimation point at around 80 °C or 176 °F.At low temperature, its vapour pressure is high enough, 1 mmHg at 53 °C, to make the solid form of naphthalene evaporate into gas. On cool surfaces, the naphthalene vapours will solidify to form needle-like crystals."
58,Sublimation (phase transition),459,How is sublimation used to purify compounds?,"Sublimation is a technique used by chemists to purify compounds. A solid is typically placed in a sublimation apparatus and heated under vacuum. Under this reduced pressure, the solid volatilizes and condenses as a purified compound on a cooled surface (cold finger), leaving a non-volatile residue of impurities behind. Once heating ceases and the vacuum is removed, the purified compound may be collected from the cooling surface.For even higher purification efficiencies, a temperature gradient is applied, which also allows for the separation of different fractions. Typical setups use an evacuated glass tube that is heated gradually in a controlled manner. The material flow is from the hot end, where the initial material is placed, to the cold end that is connected to a pump stand. By controlling temperatures along the length of the tube, the operator can control the zones of re-condensation, with very volatile compounds being pumped out of the system completely (or caught by a separate cold trap), moderately volatile compounds re-condensing along the tube according to their different volatilities, and non-volatile compounds remaining in the hot end. Vacuum sublimation of this type is also the method of choice for purification of organic compounds for use in the organic electronics industry, where very high purities (often > 99.99%) are needed to satisfy the standards for consumer electronics and other applications."
58,Sublimation (phase transition),460,How does the process of sublimation work in dye-sub printing?,"Dye-sub printing is a digital printing technology using full color artwork that works with polyester and polymer-coated substrates. Also referred to as digital sublimation, the process is commonly used for decorating apparel, signs and banners, as well as novelty items such as cell phone covers, plaques, coffee mugs, and other items with sublimation-friendly surfaces. The process uses the science of sublimation, in which heat and pressure are applied to a solid, turning it into a gas through an endothermic reaction without passing through the liquid phase."

60,World War I,469,How did the United States enter the war?,"The United States entered the war on the side of the Allies in April 1917, while the Bolsheviks seized power in the Russian October Revolution, and made peace with the Central Powers in early 1918. Freed from the Eastern Front, Germany launched an offensive in the west on March 1918, hoping to achieve a decisive victory before American troops arrived in significant numbers. Failure left the German Imperial Army exhausted and demoralised, and when the Allies took the offensive in August 1918, they could not stop the advance."
60,World War I,470,What was the German strategy in 1914?,"German strategy in 1914 was to first defeat France, then attack Russia. However, this failed, and by the end of 1914, the Western Front consisted of a continuous line of trenches stretching from the English Channel to Switzerland. The Eastern Front was more fluid, but neither side could gain a decisive advantage, despite a series of costly offensives. Attempts by both sides to bypass the stalemate caused fighting to expand into the Middle East, the Alps, the Balkans, and overseas colonies, bringing Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, and others into the war."
60,World War I,471,What was the result of the Paris Peace Conference?,"Between 29 September and 3 November 1918, Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire, and Austria-Hungary agreed to armistices with the Allies, leaving Germany isolated. Facing revolution at home, and with his army on the verge of mutiny, Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated on 9 November. The Armistice of 11 November 1918 brought the fighting to a close, while the Paris Peace Conference imposed various settlements on the defeated powers, the best-known being the Treaty of Versailles. The dissolution of the Russian, German, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman Empires resulted in the creation of new independent states, among them Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. Failure to manage the instability that resulted from this upheaval during the interwar period contributed to the outbreak of World War II in September 1939"
60,World War I,472,What was the term used to describe World War I prior to World War II?,"Prior to World War II, the events of 1914–1918 were generally known as the Great War or simply the World War. In August 1914, The Independent magazine wrote ""This is the Great War. It names itself"". In October 1914, the Canadian magazine Maclean's similarly wrote, ""Some wars name themselves. This is the Great War."" Contemporary Europeans also referred to it as ""the war to end war"" and it was also described as ""the war to end all wars"" due to their perception of its then-unparalleled scale, devastation, and loss of life. After World War II began in 1939, the terms became more standard, with British Empire historians, including Canadians, favouring ""The First World War"" and Americans ""World War I""."
60,World War I,473,How did Otto von Bismarck seek to isolate France and avoid a war on two fronts?,"In order to isolate France and avoid a war on two fronts, Bismarck negotiated the League of the Three Emperors (German: Dreikaiserbund) between Austria-Hungary, Russia and Germany. After Russian victory in the 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War, the League was dissolved due to Austrian concerns over Russian influence in the Balkans, an area they considered of vital strategic interest. Germany and Austria-Hungary then formed the 1879 Dual Alliance, which became the Triple Alliance when Italy joined in 1882.[13] For Bismarck, the purpose of these agreements was to isolate France by ensuring the three Empires resolved any disputes between themselves; when this was threatened in 1880 by British and French attempts to negotiate directly with Russia, he reformed the League in 1881, which was renewed in 1883 and 1885. After the agreement lapsed in 1887, he replaced it with the Reinsurance Treaty, a secret agreement between Germany and Russia to remain neutral if either were attacked by France or Austria-Hungary.[14]"
